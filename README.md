# JudaicaLink Website

## Hugo
The website is generated using Hugo. Simply download the Hugo executable 
(Currently used version on the server: [0.31.1](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases/tag/v0.31.1) )

You have to add hugo in your environment variables under Path:

For example: C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\IT\Installations\hugo_0.31.1_Windows-64bit

In your command prompt go to the main directory of the repository (where this README.md file is) and execute "hugo server". 

For example: C:\Users\YourName\Desktop\IT\Githubprojects\judaicalink-site>hugo server

Afterwards, you can browse the website locally under http://localhost:1313
