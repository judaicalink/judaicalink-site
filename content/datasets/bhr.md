The Biographisches Handbuch der Rabbiner is an online 
encyclopedia provided by the [Salomon L. Steinheim-Institute
for German-Jewish history](http://www.steinheim-institut.de) at the University of Duisburg-Essen, 
edited by Michael Brocke and Julius Carlebach.

The Steinheim Institute does research in the field of German-Jewish history as of 
the Middle Ages to the present. It investigates the complex patterns of interrelations between Jewish and general history from a religious and social historical, as well as literary and cultural studies perspectives. By virtue of paying special attention to intra-Jewish contexts, traditions and sources, the institute's research provides new insights into how Jews in German-speaking areas and in the whole of Europe shaped their identities and their history in many various fields 
with self-confidence. 

The goal of this encyclopedia is to be a complete directory of 
all rabbis who lived and worked in or originated from German-speaking areas 
since the age of enlightenment.

The encyclopedia consists of two parts:

Part 1: Die Rabbiner der Emanzipationszeit in den deutschen, 
böhmischen und großpolnischen Ländern (1781 – 1871), edited by Carsten Wilke.

Part 2: Die Rabbiner im Deutschen Reich (1871 – 1945), 
edited by Katrin Nele Jansen.
