List of persons from DBpedia.
<!--more-->

Currently, this dataset contains a set of Rabbis extracted from DBpedia. This was done using an iterative process to identify classes that are associated with Rabbis and consequently all Rabbis associated with these classes.

In a second step, we created links to persons in the common authority file (Gemeinsame Normdatei, GND) of the German National Library.
