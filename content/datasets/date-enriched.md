This is work in progress. The idea is to parse all available dates and create
these additional properties:

- jl:birthYear
- jl:birthMonth
- jl:birthDay

Issues: 

- birthDay might be confused with birthDate. 
- birthDate should be the parsed datetime, current String representation should go to jl:birthDateString.

Same for deathDate, of course.
