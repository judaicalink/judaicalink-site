With JudaicaLink Labs, we create a new web application to access our data and work with it.
<!--more-->

Within the lecture "Web Programming", an undergrade Information Sciences course at Stuttgart Media University, the students developed a prototype for a web application that allowed the search of JudaicaLink data as well as the easy loading of datasets in a locally installed triple store.

The idea was to make it easier to get started with JudaicaLink development and to make it maybe even possible to provide the application to scholars to work locally with JudaicaLink.

Currently, the new prototype is evaluated internally, stay tuned for further information what we might be able to do with it.
