We have implemented an <a href="https://labs.judaicalink.org/search/judaicalink_search_index">Advanced Search for the Knowledge Graph</a> to have a better search experience.
<!--more-->

Now you are able to combine search keywords with the boolean operators - AND, OR, NOT and you can search through the specific fields - Name, Alternatives, Publication, 
Birthdate, Deathdate, Birthlocation and Deathlocation. In the future we want to implement filters and improve further search functionalities.
