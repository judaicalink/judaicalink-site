Then have a look at our project GitHub: https://github.com/wisslab/judaicalink-loader

There you can find the ontology used in JudaicaLink datasets as well as the source codes and descriptions of each generated datasets and our Hugo-based dataset loader. 

Each section contains all the steps, trials and errors that we have been through to reach to the final datasets for which public [SPARQL endpoint](http://data.judaicalink.org/sparql.html) is also available. 

Moreover, you can download the datasets [here](http://www.judaicalink.org/datasets).
